# Pi Agent Harness

Portable configuration layer for [`pi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) — the multi-agent coding CLI. This repo (`~/.pi/agent`) is the shareable half. Personal context lives in a separate vault (`~/.agents`).

**Model stack:** Claude Haiku 4.5 (orchestrator, medium-thinking) + Claude Sonnet 4.6 (workers/reviewers). Requires Anthropic API key.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- `npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
- Git
- Anthropic API key

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone harness

```bash
git clone <dot-pi-repo-url> ~/.pi/agent
```

### 2. Create personal context vault

The harness loads `~/.agents/` at every session start. This directory is **not** included — it is personal. Create it from scratch or use this repo's structure as a template.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/{context,standards}
```

Required files — write these yourself:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.agents/context/identity.md` | Your role, team, communication style, behavioral rules |
| `~/.agents/context/environment.md` | Your device paths, shell aliases, active technologies |
| `~/.agents/context/long-term.md` | Domain knowledge, project context, decision log |
| `~/.agents/standards/code-style.md` | Your project's commit format, language conventions |

### 3. Copy settings

```bash
cp ~/.pi/agent/settings.json.example ~/.pi/agent/settings.json
```

`settings.json` is gitignored — pi writes runtime state back to it on every session (last model used, changelog version, etc). The example file has the correct defaults (`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`, medium thinking, all extensions, Tokyo Night theme). Copy it once; pi owns it from there.

### 4. Set up providers

```bash
pi auth login
```

Log in to the providers you plan to use. At minimum:

- **Anthropic** — orchestrator + workers (`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`)

To verify available models after login:

```bash
pi --list-models
```

### 5. Verify

```bash
pi --version
pi "hello"
```

## Context Loading Chain

`AGENTS.md` at startup loads (in order):

```
@~/.agents/context/identity.md
@~/.agents/context/environment.md
@~/.agents/context/long-term.md
@~/.agents/standards/code-style.md
@~/.agents/standards/tool-policy.md
```

`APPEND_SYSTEM.md` appends harness-specific rules after the above (routing policy, TUI rendering overrides, agent notes, pre-fix diagnostic gate).

---

## Model Routing

Orchestrator model is set in `settings.json`. Worker/subagent models are set per-agent in `agents/*.md` frontmatter.

| Config | Controls |
|---|---|
| `settings.json` → `defaultProvider` + `defaultModel` | Orchestrator (main session model) |
| `agents/<name>.md` → `model:` frontmatter | Per-agent model override for subagents |

Subagent dispatch is handled via `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` routing rules. The orchestrator decides when to delegate based on prompt context — no automatic prompt classification is applied.

### Changing the model stack

**Orchestrator** — edit `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "anthropic",
  "defaultModel": "claude-haiku-4-5"
}
```

**Per-agent worker model** — edit `agents/<name>.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: worker
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
thinking: medium
---
```

Run `pi --list-models` to see available model IDs for your configured providers.

---

## Extensions

Loaded automatically at startup via `settings.json` `extensions` array.

| Extension | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `adjutant-editor.ts` | TUI editor layout config |
| `adjutant-greeting.ts` | Startup greeting with session context |
| `bash-truncator.ts` | Truncates oversized bash output to prevent context overflow |
| `context-resolver.ts` | Resolves `@`-includes in AGENTS.md at load time |
| `cost-tracker.ts` | Tracks per-turn + per-session token cost in TUI status bar |
| `extension-watcher.ts` | Detects stale extension cache, warns before long sessions |
| `first-run.ts` | One-time onboarding wizard on fresh installs |
| `gmail.ts` | Gmail API integration (requires Google OAuth) |
| `guardrails.ts` | Blocks or confirms destructive ops (SSH rm/reboot, npm publish) |
| `session-name-status.ts` | Shows active session name in TUI status bar |
| `tool-cache.ts` | Caches repeated tool results within a session |
| `tui-dryrun.ts` | ANSI validation guard — blocks TUI edits without dry-run verification |
| `atuin.ts` | *(disabled by default)* Tracks pi bash commands in [Atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin) history with author `pi`. Requires `atuin` installed and `atuin hook install pi` run. Enable by changing `-extensions/atuin.ts` to `+extensions/atuin.ts` in `settings.json`. |
| `prompt-classifier.ts` | *(disabled)* No-op classifier stub |
| `prompt-router.ts` | *(disabled)* Dead letter routing extension |

To disable an extension, prefix its entry with `-` in `settings.json`:

```json
"-extensions/gmail.ts"
```

| Agent | Purpose | Model |
|---|---|---|
| `linux-doctor` | System-level diagnostics (OS, drivers, services) | gemini-3.1-pro-preview |
| `session-auditor` | Audits active session for context drift and constraint violations | MiniMax-M3 |
| `tui-worker` | Specialized worker for TUI extension edits with 4-layer test loop | sonnet-4-6 |

Package agents (from `npm:pi-subagents`, included automatically):

| Agent | Role | Model |
|---|---|---|
| `scout` | Fast codebase recon | — |
| `context-builder` | Deep analysis + meta-prompt for planning | anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 *(local override)* |

## Customization

### Change the default model

Edit `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "google",
  "defaultModel": "gemini-2.5-pro"
}
```

### Add a personal agent

Create `~/.pi/agent/agents/<name>.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: What this agent does and when to invoke it.
model: openai-codex/gpt-5.5
thinking: high
---
# My Agent

System prompt content here.
```

### Add a skill

Create `~/.pi/agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description used for auto-triggering.
---

# Skill Title

Skill instructions here.
```

Run `/skill-creator` for the full schema and validation guide.

### Change theme

```bash
pi theme set tokyonight   # or: dracula, nord, gruvbox, rose-pine, etc.
```

Or edit `settings.json` → `"theme"`.

---

## What NOT to Commit

Already in `.gitignore`, but worth knowing:

| Path | Reason |
|---|---|
| `settings.json` | Pi rewrites this every session (last model, changelog version) — use `settings.json.example` to ship defaults |
| `auth.json` | API credentials |
| `sessions/` | Session transcripts |
| `cost-history.jsonl` | Machine-specific cost data |
| `run-history.jsonl` | Runtime artifacts |
| `usage-data/` | Pi-insights reports |
| `logs/` | Debug logs |
| `intercom/` | IPC mailboxes |

Your personal `~/.agents/` vault is a separate repo — never accidentally commit it here.

---

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/.pi/agent
git pull
```

Extension changes take effect on next `pi` session start.

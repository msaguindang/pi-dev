# NTV Worktree Manager

A skill for managing synchronized git worktrees across the four core NTV repositories. Worktrees are created **inside** each repo at `<repo>/.worktrees/<branch>` — git-native and automatically gitignored.

## When to use this skill
- Starting a new ticket (`feat`, `fix`, `hotfix`, `test`).
- Setting up a new worktree for a specific task.
- Ensuring repositories are fetched and initialized after creating a worktree.

## Workflow: Create/Sync Worktrees for a Ticket

This workflow uses `NTV_DIR` from the environment (must be exported — the script exits with an error if unset).

1.  **Ask for Details**: Prompt the user for:
    - **Ticket ID** (e.g., `456`)
    - **Description** (e.g., `fix-auth-bug`)
    - **Type** (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `hotfix`)
    - **Selected Repos** (Which of `api`, `dash`, `server`, `ui` need the worktree?)
2.  **Construct Branch Name**: Formulate the standard branch: `[type]/[ID]-[Description]` (e.g., `fix/456-fix-auth-bug`).
3.  **Execute**: Invoke `scripts/manage_worktrees.sh` with the ticket details.
4.  **Report**: Summarize the created directories and next steps.

### Resulting structure

```
$NTV_DIR/
├── api-v1/
│   └── .worktrees/
│       └── fix/456-fix-auth-bug/      ← worktree
├── dashboard-v1/
│   └── .worktrees/
│       └── fix/456-fix-auth-bug/
├── player-server/
│   └── .worktrees/
│       └── fix/456-fix-auth-bug/
└── player-ui/
    └── .worktrees/
        └── fix/456-fix-auth-bug/
```

`.worktrees/` is gitignored by default (git adds it to `.git/info/exclude` automatically for worktrees).

## Safety Guidelines
- **NEVER** overwrite an existing worktree directory without explicit user confirmation.
- **ALWAYS** perform a `git fetch origin` before creating a new worktree to ensure the base branch is up-to-date.
- **VERIFY** `NTV_DIR` is set and all paths resolve before executing.
- **USE** the provided `manage_worktrees.sh` script to maintain consistency.

## Bundled Resources
- `scripts/manage_worktrees.sh` — executes all git operations
